### benefits of the topic-based communication

Benefits of AMQP are interoperability between different configurations and infrastructures. It enables realiable communication betweed distributed software components and microservices at any scale. It's possible to decouple application components to make them run and fail independently. This makes applications fault tolerant and easy to scale. It also helps with keeping messages in exact order and is usefull in systems that depend on receiving orders in the correct order and exactly once.

### Main learnings

Using docker compose to do more complex applications with health checking. Also using RabbitMQ was new for me.
